# Bech32

A small utility library to encode/decode bech32 addresses with source code taken from https://github.com/guillaumebonnot/bech32 to encode/decode Bech32 addresses.

This project exists only to be able to deploy a NuGet package to prevent endless copy & pasting of the excellent work 
of **Guillaume Bonnot** and **Palekhov Ilia**, who deserve full credits for their work.
